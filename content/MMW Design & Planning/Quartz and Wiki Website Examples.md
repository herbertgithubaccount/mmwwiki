description: A list of interesting Quartz websites that MMW could borrow ideas from
---
## Quartz sites:

### [Topo Da Mente](https://www.pmcf.xyz/topo-da-mente/)

---
### [3D Artist's Handbook](https://sidney-eliot.github.io/3d-artists-handbook/)

---
### [Bianca's Digital Garden](https://garden.bianca.digital/)

---
### [Stories with Dice](https://storieswithdice.com/)

---
### [3fecta.party](https://3fecta.party/)

---
### [CS Notes](https://notes.yxy.ninja/)

---
### [Owlly Lab](https://www.mara-li.fr/)

**Why is it cool**
* They made a working hamburger menu on mobile for the Explorer
* Extensive customization of layout

---

### [Mage the Awakening Wiki](https://lakeinlove.github.io/Mage-The-Awakening/)

Just a pretty Quartz site with a simple but navigable layout. Some questionable design choices, such as choosing to make all bold words a different colour (making them easily confused with hyperlinks).

### [Daniel Hintz](https://dhintz137.github.io/quartz/)

**Key points of interest:**
- The [A Little About Me](https://dhintz137.github.io/quartz/About) page contains a clickable image gallery pane where each image has a caption. 
	- This is a custom-made component not supported out of the box by Quartz -- _check the CSS and JS_
- The [Metropolis-Hastings MCMC from Scratch âœ¨](https://dhintz137.github.io/quartz/MCMC_from_scratch) page contains:
	- Readable table design with [zebra stripes and highlight on-hover](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_styling.asp)
	- Embeds [this interactive graph](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~dhintz1/4/#/) directly in the page by using the HTML `<iframe>` tag 
		- Graph from [Plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/). For the record, this tool is _amazing_, though likely only useful in fringe cases. See this [interactive 3D cube graph](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~abidondo/18)

## Non-Quartz Sites:

### [Cyberpunk 2077 Modding](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/)

Created with Gitbook, this is the modding wiki for Cyberpunk 2077

### [The Integral Guide to Well-Being](https://integralguide.com/About)

Published with [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish), it features a visually pleasing UI, including support for [Stacked Pages](https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Tabs#Stack+tab+groups) and folder icons.
