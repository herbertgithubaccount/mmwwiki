## About

Wikipedia and other wiki-style sites commonly place banner-style maintenance templates on pages which have one or more issues that need addressing. These templates highlight what issues need addressing and invite contributors to contribute to correct these issues. For example, Wikipedia uses [Wikipedia:Template index/Disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_index/Disputes) and [Wikipedia:Template index/Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_index/Cleanup). Maintenance templates can be placed at the top of an article, or at the top of a section within an article.

> Example of a Wikipedia 'cleanup' maintenance template. 

Fandom Wikis often implement these templates in stylized ways which reference character quotes, and/or events from the fictional universe the wiki documents. 

- For example, the Star Wars wiki [Wookiepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) uses stylized maintenance templates extensively -- [see here for their full list](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Maintenance_templates)

To add flair to the wiki, custom Morrowind-themed maintenance templates can be created, using Obsidian-style [Callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts). Callout icons could be images of the character whom the quote is from, or one of many icons used in Morrowind (e.g., spell, disease, skill, faction icons etc.)

## Morrowind-Themed Maintenance Templates: 

 A list of draft maintenance templates, sorted by category. Where more than one potential option is given for what the final maintenance template could be, the callout will specify if it is "option 1", "2" and so on.

### Article Categorization Issues:

For pages that are placed in an incorrect category, or directly in `/content`.

- E.g., a guide on creating [[Guides/Patches/index|Patches]] is placed in `/content/Guides` instead of `/content/Guides/Patches`.

> #### Uncategorized Article: 
> 
>> [!warning]+  _"You've finally arrived, but our records don't show from where"_
>>  
>> This article has not been added to any category. Please help out by adding it to a category so it can be listed with similar articles.

>>  
>> This article has been placed in the wrong category, or a better category for it exists than what it is currently in. Please help out by moving the article to a more suitable category so it can be listed with similar articles. 
>>  
>> \*_replace default icon with picture of a High Elf Male wizard._ 
>> 

### Article Tag Issues: 

Maintenance templates For the following issues:

- An article is missing tags. 
- An article contains tags that are not relevant to its content.

> #### Missing Tags: 
> 
>> [!warning]+  _"The letter that preceded you mentioned you were born under a certain sign. And what would that be?"_

>> 
>> \*_option 1_

>> 
>> This article contains tags that are not sufficiently related to the content. Please help by editing the tags so it can be listed with similar articles. 
>> 
>> \*_replace icon with Ash Zombie face_
>> 
>> \*_option 1_

### Category Maintenance 

Maintenance templates for subject 'categories' (i.e., the subfolders contained within `/content`). Each subfolder contains an `index.md` file that acts as a folder-page for the category, so any 'category maintenance' templates should be inserted there.

> 
> #### Underpopulated Category:
> 
> > [!warning]+ _"Seen any elves? HA HA HA HA HA HA HA"_
> > 
> > This category could be populated with more articles. Please help out by contributing written articles. 
> > 
> > \*_replace icon with generic Nord face_ 
> 
> ---
> 
> #### Overpopulated Category:
> 
> > [!warning]+ _"Candy, candy -- he makes so much! Uncle Sweetshare has a magic touch!"_
> > 
> > This category is overpopulated. Please consider splitting it into smaller subcategories.
> > 
> > \*_replace icon with Uncle Sweetshare_
>

> 
> #### Category Undergoing Maintenance:
> 
> For categories that are being reorganized.
> 
> > [!warning]+ _"Where is that slave? Here not long ago."_
> > 
> > Articles in this category are currently being recategorized. Be aware when adding new articles to this category while this message is up. If you wish to know who is working on the category, please consult the Discussions tab on Github for discussion on this index page.
