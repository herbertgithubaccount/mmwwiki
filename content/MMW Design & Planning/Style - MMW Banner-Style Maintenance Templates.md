## About

Wikipedia and other wiki-style sites commonly place banner-style maintenance templates on pages which have one or more issues that need addressing. These templates highlight what issues need addressing and invite contributors to contribute to correct these issues. For example, Wikipedia uses [Wikipedia:Template index/Disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_index/Disputes) and [Wikipedia:Template index/Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_index/Cleanup). Maintenance templates can be placed at the top of an article, or at the top of a section within an article.

Fandom Wikis often implement these templates in stylized ways which reference character quotes, and/or events from the fictional universe the wiki documents. 

- For example, the Star Wars wiki [Wookiepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) uses stylized maintenance templates extensively -- [see here for their full list](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Maintenance_templates)

To add flair to the wiki, custom Morrowind-themed maintenance templates can be created, using Obsidian-style [Callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts). Callout icons could be images of the character whom the quote is from, or one of many icons used in Morrowind (e.g., spell, disease, skill, faction icons etc.)

## Template Idea Drafts: 

Sorted by category. Where more than one potential option is given for what the final maintenance template could be, the callout will specify if it is "option 1", "2" and so on.

### Article Categorization Issues:

For pages that are placed in an incorrect category, or directly in `/content`.

- E.g., a guide on creating [[Guides/Patches/index|Patches]] is placed in `/content/Guides` instead of `/content/Guides/Patches`.

### Tag Issues: 

Maintenance templates For the following issues:

- An entire tag is judged to be un-useful or too insignificant - a tag and its corresponding index page are scheduled for deletion. 
- An article is missing tags. 
- An article contains tags that are not relevant to its content.
